    <div class="text-box">
        <p>To the dearest</p>
        <p>As I'm writing this, I'm waiting for you to wake up and my back hurts so bad from coding this for the entire day xd (even with chatgpt it was so consuming). Honestly, I didn't expect us to talk ever again so I'm really glad that it worked out, even though I'm feeling low-key torn between my opposite feelings. Still, I wish you the best and I am happy to be part of your life, and you to be part of mine. Hopefully, we'll know each other for a long time. I don't know if this entire thing looks cheesy or flirty, I wasn't sure of what else to make for your birthday. I really hope you like it (i don't know js well so idk what i did xdd). Finally, happy birthday pookie, love you and I will always support you and you are an amazing person, even if you make mistakes, even if you sometimes don't feel confident or good enough, you are only human, and an amazing one even.  I hope your fever is gone by the time you read this lol, have a healthy, filled with good memories and productive year, and may all your goals become true!!!</p>
        <p>happy birthday, xoxo</p>
